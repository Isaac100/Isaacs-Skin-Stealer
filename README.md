# Isaacs-Skin-Stealer
This is a VB.NET application for getting Minecraft user's skins. I made this program a while back, like in 2015, and then in 2018 I went to use it and realized the Minecraft API had changed, so I updated it to work with the new API, and I just recently finished it up and removed some bugs.  

Also I'm not very good at organizing code so it might look a little messy.

## Downloading it 
To download it, you can either: 
- download the whole project and open it up in Visual Studio to run it from there 
- download the installer [here](https://github.com/Isaac100/Isaacs-Skin-Stealer/raw/master/Installer/IsaacsSkinStealer.exe) (If you have SmartScreen on it will probably block it but that's only because I don't have it signed) 
- or you can just download the exe from /bin/release/. (You would also need to download the Newtonsoft.json.dll for it to work.)

## Using it 
The program is simple, just type in a minecraft username, click find skin and it will show up, then click save skin and then you can save it to wherever.
